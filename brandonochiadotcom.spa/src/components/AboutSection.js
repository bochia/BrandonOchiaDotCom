                Hi! My name's Brandon and welcome to my website. I'm a full-stack developer who specializes in the backend. I enjoy anything coding related,
                and have a passion for implementing functionality and exploring new technologies.
                This web app acts as both my portofolio, as well as my personal playground to try new technologies, techniques, and explore the unkown.
                This site was built with ASP.NET Core Web API and ReactJS, and runs on an Azure app service. This site also uses the following technologies: Entity Framework Core, Bootstrap, AJAX, etc...
                When you visit each of my projects you will find a description of its purpose and any lessons learned.
                Thank you for taking the time to explore my work, and enjoy! Also feel free to take a look at my resume.
            </p>
